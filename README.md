# Order Book Coding Assignment


### Context of the problem

We are running a small exchange and we must ensure that its behaviour is fully deterministic
and fully compliant with regulations. Our exchange is quite small but very optimized, so even
if it supports only one feature, the limit order, it’s hard to make it right. To ensure that our
exchange is behaving properly, we need to compare its output with the one generated by a
verifier. The verifier does not have any performance constraints, it just has to behave
properly.
Your task is to build that verifier. We will check if our exchange is behaving correctly
comparing its output with the one coming from your assignment

### High level description

An exchange allows the buyers and sellers of a product to discover each other and trade.
Buyers and sellers (traders) submit orders to the exchange and the exchange applies simple
rules to determine if a trade has occurred. The dominant kind of exchange is a central limit
order book (CLOB) where orders are matched using ‘price time priority’.
When placing an order, traders specify if they wish to buy or sell, the limit price ie. worst
possible price they will trade at, and the quantity (number of shares) they wish to trade. On
our exchange trades only occur during the processing of a newly posted order, and happen
immediately, which is known as ‘continuous trading’.

### Matching example
As orders arrive at the exchange, they are considered for aggressive matching first against
the opposite side of the book. Once this is completed, any remaining order quantity will rest
on their own side of the book. Consider 3 orders have been submitted to the exchange, in
the following order:

● Buy 1000 @ 99

● Buy 1200 @ 98

● Buy 500 @ 99

As there are no Sell orders yet, they rest on the order book as follows (note Buy for 98 is
lowest priority):

```
  Bids (Buying)   |   Asks (Selling)
---------------------------------------
Quantity | Price  |  Price | Quantity
  1000   |  99    |   
   500   |  99    |   
  1200   |  99    |   
```


Price time priority refers to the order in which orders in the book are eligible to be matched
during the aggressive phase. Orders are first matched in order of price (most aggressive to
least aggressive), then by arrival time into the book (oldest to newest). A Sell order is now
submitted, with a limit price that does not cross with any of the existing resting orders:

● Sell 2000 @ 101

```
  Bids (Buying)   |   Asks (Selling)
---------------------------------------
Quantity | Price  |  Price | Quantity
  1000   |  99    |   101  |   2000
   500   |  99    |   
  1200   |  99    |   
```

A **Sell** order is now submitted that is aggressively-priced: 

● Sell 2000 @ 95

This triggers a matching event as there are orders on the **Buy** side that match with the new
**Sell** order.

The orders are matched in price time priority (first by price, then by arrival time into the book)
i.e.
        ● Buy 1000 @ 99 is matched first (as it is the oldest order at the highest price level)
        ● Buy 500 @ 99 is matched second (as it is at the highest price level and arrived after the BUY 1000 @ 99 order)
        ● Buy 500 @ 98 is matched third (as it is at a lower price. This partially fills the resting order of 1200, leaving 700 in the order book)

```
  Bids (Buying)   |   Asks (Selling)
---------------------------------------
Quantity | Price  |  Price | Quantity
  700    |  98    |   101  |   2000
```   


### Limit order handling

The assignment is to produce executable code that will accept orders from standard input,
and to emit to standard output the trades as they occur. Once standard input ends, the
program should print the final contents of the order book.

Order inputs will be given as a comma separated values, one order per line of the input,
delimited by a new line character. The fields are: * *order-id, side, price, quantity* *. Side will have a
value of ‘B’ for **Buy** or ‘S’ for **Sell**. Price and quantity will both be integers. * *order-id* * should be
handled as a string.

Example 1

In this example no buyer or seller is willing the pay the opposing price so no trades occur

```
$ cat test1.txt
10000,B,98,25500
10005,S,105,20000
10001,S,100,500
10002,S,100,10000
10003,B,99,50000
10004,S,103,100
$ ./exchange &lt; test1.txt
  50,000 99 | 100 500
  25,500 98 | 100 10,000
            | 103 100
            | 105 20,000
$
```

MD5 (output) = 8ff13aad3e61429bfb5ce0857e846567

Which represents the following order book:

```
  Bids (Buying)   |   Asks (Selling)
---------------------------------------
Quantity | Price  |  Price | Quantity
  50000  |  99    |   100  |   500
  25000  |  99    |   100  |  10000
                  |   103  |   100
                  |   105  |  20000
```

Example 2

If an order is then submitted to Buy 16000 @ 105p, it will fill completely against the resting
orders, producing the following output:
```
$ cp test1.txt test2.txt
$ echo &quot;10006,B,105,16000&quot; &gt;&gt; test2.txt
$ ./exchange &lt; test2.txt
trade 10006,10001,100,500
trade 10006,10002,100,10000
trade 10006,10004,103,100
trade 10006,10005,105,5400
    50,000 99 | 105 14,600
    25,500 98 |
$
```

MD5 (output) = ce8e7e5ab26ab5a7db6b7d30759cf02e

Trade output must indicate the aggressing order-id, the resting order-id, the price of the match
and the quantity traded, followed by a newline.

The order book output should be formatted to a fixed width using the following format:
```
000,000,000 000000 | 000000 000,000,000
```
If a value is too small to cover the whole reserved area, it should be left padded with spaces

Please note that once submitted, orders are not modified by further input. There is no need
to maintain more than one order book, all orders are for the same product.

### Deliverables

The assignment must be completed in Java or Kotlin within a two weeks timeframe
